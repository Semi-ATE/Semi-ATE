## The Semi-ATE Test-App Package

This package provides the connection end point of a generated test program. It is automatically added to any Semi-ATE test-project that has been created using the semi-ate-spyder plugin. It is used to start/stop the test program and for transferring the STDF test results. The execution of a test program is controlled by the control application from the **semi-ate-control-app** package.
