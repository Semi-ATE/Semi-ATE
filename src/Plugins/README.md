In this directory we develop the ATE.org plugin cookiecutter.
In a later stage this will be moved out as a plugin for spyder5

- The '[Semi-ATE Testers](https://github.com/ate-org/ATE.org/tree/master/src/Plugins/semi_ate_testers)' directory is the template as pre-scribed by ATE.org.plugins

- The '[cookiecutter](https://github.com/ate-org/ATE.org/tree/master/src/Plugins/cookiecutter)' directory is how the 'template' is translated in a bigger whole (github repo)
