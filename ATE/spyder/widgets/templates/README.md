# ATE/org/templates

This directory contains template files that are used to create a new project.
It holds 'templates' for:

    - the spyder ide itself (should probably move out once we have the ATE.org plugin)
    - default project documentation.
    - the jinja2 templates used by ATE/org/coding/generators
