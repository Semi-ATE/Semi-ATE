The `HarwareWizard` needs to create 3 `common.py` files :

- HWx --> this `common.py` holds acctuators, instruments, tester ... and also the 'from ATE.spyder.widgets.abc import testABC'
 - FT --> this `common.py` holds 'import ..common', further the TE can put his 'common' stuff here under
 - PR --> this `common.py` holds 'import ..common', further the TE can put his 'common' stuff here under
